EXPERIENCE  

- Postdoctoral Fellow (Aug 2023 – Aug 2024), Cape Breton University, Sydney, NS  
  Research Focus: Developing explainable ML models to analyze real-world healthcare data from Nova Scotia.  
  Objectives: Identify risk factors and create guidelines to tackle Unplanned Hospital Readmissions (UHR).  
  Responsibilities: Managed the entire research process including formulating questions, literature review, experimentation, paper writing, and presenting findings.  
  Achievements: Developed a guideline that reduced screening by 50% while capturing over 72% of UHR cases.

- Postdoctoral Fellow (Jan 2022 – July 2023), Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS  
  Research Focus: Reviewed active learning for high-recall information and provided solutions to social science researchers analyzing large textual datasets.  
  Responsibilities: Designed and implemented an active learning system in Python, enabling real-time interaction with ML models.  
  Achievements: Enabled social science researchers to retrieve information from over 2.9 million news articles, leading to novel research. Organized results using LLMs.

- Research Fellow (Apr 2017 – Oct 2021), Institute for Computer Science and Engineering, Bahía Blanca, Argentina  
  Overview: Interdisciplinary project focusing on extracting causal graphs from news article texts using causality learning, time series analysis, NLP, and ML tools.  
  Achievements:  
    * Built and evaluated an ML system using LLMs to detect events and variables from news articles, improving F1-score by 13.3%.  
    * Condensed large text corpora into causal graphs using causal learning techniques.  
    * Applied causal learning methods to an energy demand time-series dataset, reducing forecast errors by 12-27%.  
    * Published articles on causal learning, NLP, and energy forecasting in top journals/conferences.

- Teaching (Oct 2015 – Dec 2021), Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina  
  Roles: Teaching assistant, head teaching assistant, and professor in undergraduate courses.  
  Courses: Object-oriented Programming, Computer Networking, and Embedded Systems.
