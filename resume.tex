\raisebox{1.\height}{\textbf{Postdoctoral Fellow, Healthcare Analytics, Cape Breton University}} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2023 --- Aug 2024}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed explainable ML models using 600K+ hospital discharge records from Nova Scotia to predict 30-day Unplanned Hospital Readmission (UHR) risk. \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Identified key risk factors and created guidelines to reduce screenings by 50\% while capturing 72\% of UHR cases.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Utilized SHAP, Permutation Feature Importance, and Random Forest for model interpretability and accuracy.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Handled dataset imbalance using various techniques and combined discharge records for the same patients to
    enhance detection performance.
\end{itemize}

\raisebox{1.\height}{\textbf{ Postdoctoral Fellow, NLP Researcher, Dalhousie University}} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2022 --- Jul 2023}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Designed and implemented an interactive active learning NLP system in Python, enabling real-time training of a logistic regression model and facilitating user interaction for efficient information retrieval.\vspace{-0.2cm}
   \item Allowed navigation through a corpus of over 2.9 million news articles, enhancing research capabilities for social scientists.\vspace{-0.2cm}
   \item Employed large language models (Top2Vec) to categorize retrieval results by topic.

\raisebox{0.85\height}{\textbf{ NLP Research Fellow, Institute for Computer Science and Engineering}} \hfill \textbf{Apr 2017 --- Oct 2021}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led an interdisciplinary project that integrated NLP and causal inference to extract causal graphs from a corpus of 1.8 million New York Times news articles, utilizing causality learning and time series analysis tools.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item The first step involved extracting information from the text using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and CNN neural networks, built upon representations created with large language models (BERT).\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item The second step transformed the extracted information into time series data and applied causal discovery tools, including PCMCI, PC, DirectLiNGAM, and Vector Autoregression (VAR).\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Combined the entire pipeline to summarize large volumes of text on specific topics into causal graph visualizations that depict relevant events and their causal interactions.
