\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed explainable ML models using 600K+ hospital discharge records from Nova Scotia to predict 30-day Unplanned Hospital Readmission (UHR) risk. \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Identified key risk factors and created guidelines to reduce screenings by 50\% while capturing 72\% of UHR cases.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Utilized SHAP, Permutation Feature Importance, and Random Forest for model interpretability and accuracy.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Handled dataset imbalance using various techniques and combined discharge records for the same patients to
    enhance detection performance.
\end{itemize}
% Our research focused on using explainable ML applied to the real-world data in the healthcare domain to identify risk factors and obtain insight for medical personnel to handle the unplanned hospital readmission problem in Nova Scotia. I handle the entire lifecycle of our research. From formulating research questions, conducting thorough literature reviews, executing experiments to produce both theoretically grounded and applicable solutions, and writing scientific articles and presenting our results in relevant venues.

% I reviewed the state-of-the-art active learning for high-recall information retrieval to provide a solution to social science researchers conducting their research using large amounts of textual data. I designed and implemented an active learning system in Python that enabled researchers to interact with a ML model and train it in real-time. Social science researchers could perform information retrieval over millions of news articles using our system, which led them to conduct novel research in their fields.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Led an interdisciplinary project that integrated NLP and causal inference to extract causal graphs from a corpus of 1.8 million New York Times news articles, utilizing causality learning and time series analysis tools.\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item The first step involved extracting information from the text using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and CNN neural networks, built upon representations created with large language models (BERT).\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item The second step transformed the extracted information into time series data and applied causal discovery tools, including PCMCI, PC, DirectLiNGAM, and Vector Autoregression (VAR).\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Combined the entire pipeline to summarize large volumes of text on specific topics into causal graph visualizations that depict relevant events and their causal interactions.
\end{itemize}

% I collaborated closely with Computer Science and Economics researchers to design a framework to extract causal graphs from a large corpus of news article texts. I developed a term-weighting technique to identify relevant concepts present in texts. I built and evaluated a ML model to identify ongoing events from news articles. We used causal learning tools on top of the extracted variables (concepts and events) to condense the information from the text into a single causal graph. As a case study, we also applied causal learning tools to a real-world energy demand time-series dataset to understand the role of causality in forecasting analysis. 

% I used causality learning and time series analysis tools (primarily in Python, some in R), natural language processing, and ML tools to conduct the project. 
% We published articles on term weighting, causal learning, natural language processing, and energy forecasting in several high-impact journals and conferences.
